  abstract  = {The pandemic has forced people to use digital technologies and accelerated the digitalization of many businesses. Using digital technologies generates a huge amount of data that are exploited by Business Intelligence (BI) to make decisions and improve the management of firms. This becomes particularly relevant in the healthcare sector where decisions are traditionally made on the physicians’ experience. Much work has been done on applying BI in the healthcare industry. Most of these studies were focused only on IT or medical aspects, while the usage of BI for improving the management of healthcare processes is an under-investigated field. This research aims at filling this gap by investigating whether a decision support system (DSS) model based on the exploitation of data through BI can outperform traditional experience-driven practices for managing processes in the healthcare domain. Focusing on the managing process of the therapeutic path of oncological patients, specifically BRCA-mutated women with breast cancer, a DSS model for benchmarking the costs of various treatment paths was developed in two versions: the first is experience-driven while the second is data-driven. We found that the data-driven version of the DSS model leads to a more accurate estimation of the costs that could potentially be prevented in the treatment of oncological patients, thus enabling significant cost savings. A more informed decision due to a more accurate cost estimation becomes crucial in a context where optimal treatment and unique clinical recommendations for patients are absent, thus permitting a substantial improvement of the decision making in the healthcare industry.},

This paper discusses the categorized literature review of existing migration strategies, surveys the translation techniques, and also discusses the technical issues for making the migration process more effective. This review assesses the impact of existing migration strategies and shows how it has been designed according to the recent trends. In software industries, plenty of Database Migration Tools (DBMTs) are available, but finding the effective one is still a risky job. Hence, some of the DBMTs are reviewed and suggested several basic criteria for evaluating migration toolkits. The discussion of these issues will help the researchers and also database practitioner in planning the migration projects.},

Improving the quality of service in a business will have implications for the maximum profit obtained. The right technology to connect various platforms is web services. Geprek Chicken Dinner management uses two different applications for its business processes. This of course hampers business processes and requires time and energy which causes business processes to be not optimal. Therefore, the purpose of research on the design and implementation of RESTful web services at Geprek Chicken Dinner. This research produces RESTful web services applications with access token and API key features as a security system with extreme programming development methods. the black box method involves auditors and IT experts getting successful conclusions from various types of tests.

Accordingly, we intend to contribute to solve this gap by developing a decision support system toolset based on public databases of health indicators. This toolset was assembled through the implementation of a data warehousing environment for integration of legacy databases, derived from documents generated by regional health departments and collected by a state department of health, providing health managers with tools required to generate complex ad hoc aggregative queries on health data in a flexible and efficient way. According to an evaluation procedure performed by a group of local and regional health managers, the system fulfills successfully our purpose of helping to make the health management process more effective, flexible and productive.},

  abstract = {&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This study is about the factors that affect the performance of accounting information systems in hospitals in Indonesia. By using a systematic literature review method which consists of three stages, namely, planning, implementation, and reporting. The research data was obtained from Google Scholar which was published in 2013 to 2020, the initial study found in this study was 410 articles, and the total study used was 7 articles as data sources and will be analyzed further. This study only uses research with a quantitative approach. The results of a systematic literature review of all published studies state that the factors that affect the performance of accounting information systems in hospitals in Indonesia are very diverse, namely, user involvement factors, top management support, human resource capabilities, system development, and education and training programs. The main influencing factor is user involvement where hospitals should provide education and training programs for accounting information system programs so that they can improve user skills&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;},
